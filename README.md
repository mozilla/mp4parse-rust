This is an mp4 track metadata parser.

[![Build status](https://github.com/mozilla/mp4parse-rust/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mozilla/mp4parse-rust/actions)

Our primary interest is writing a pure-rust replacement for the
track metadata parser needed by Firefox.

[API documentation](https://docs.rs/mp4parse/)

# Project structure

`mp4parse` is a parser for ISO base media file format (mp4) written in rust.

`mp4parse-capi` is a C API that exposes the functionality of `mp4parse`. The C
API is intended to wrap the rust parser. As such, features should primarily
be implemented in the rust parser and exposed via the C API, rather than the C
API implementing features on its own.

## Tests

Test coverage comes from several sources:
- Conventional tests exist in `mp4parse/src/lib.rs` and
`mp4parse_capi/src/lib.rs` as well as under `mp4parse/tests` and
`mp4parse_capi/tests`. These tests can be run via `cargo test`.
- Examples are included under `mp4parse_capi/examples`. These programs should
continue to build and run after changes are made. Note, these programs are not
typically run by `cargo test`, so manual verification is required.

# Versioning

Prior to Firefox 95, versions of this library have been updated sporadically,
and uploaded to crates.io even less frequently. Going forward, there will be
a new release on github and crates.io whenever the version of the code used
in Firefox (see [toolkit/library/rust/shared/Cargo.toml](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/library/rust/shared/Cargo.toml#12)) is updated. For convenience, the
patch version will correspond to the first Firefox version the code is used in.
For example, v0.12.95 will be the version of the code used in Firefox 95.
